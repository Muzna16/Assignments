    <h2>About me</h2><hr>
    <h4>Hi! I am MUZNA YUMMAN, an accomplished masters student with a robust foundation in mathematics and computational skills. My master’s research focused on asymmetric cryptography, resulting in a successful publication in an international journal “Symmetry,” MDPI (IF: 2.713). I am passionate about exploring the mathematical aspect in computer science and information technology. Simultaneously, I am an enthusiastic participant in hackathons and thoroughly enjoy engaging in coding competitions. I have take on the role of a team lead in three international hackathons, and have also served as a section leader in Stanford Code in Place 2023 and 2024.
